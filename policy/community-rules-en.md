# Discord Community Rules and Expectations

---

1. Be courteous and respectful to the community. We are welcoming of everyone regardless of age, race, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

1. Do not use derogatory language or engage in harassing behavior. We have no tolerance for slurs or targeted attacks against individuals or groups.

1. This Discord server is open to the public, so please keep conversations to an approximate PG-13 rating.

1. You are responsible for your own behavior here. Happy, sad, drunk, high, or otherwise, please be aware of how your conduct will affect others.

1. Constructive debate is welcome, heated arguments are not. If a conversation turns into an argument, we ask all parties to disengage. If mediation is required, please contact staff instead of trying to arbitrate the situation yourself.

1. We do not endorse or offer support for any software, modules, or sites  which violate copyright or encourage piracy. Any discussion related to copyright infringement will be removed.

1. We have some topic specific channels. Sometimes a conversation will need to move, which doesn't mean it needs to end.

1. The moderating team will handle violations of these rules. If you have a concern or dispute please notify any of the Moderators or use the @Moderator alert for an urgent response.

1. Moderators have final authority to enforce the rules of the server, please comply with moderator requests without dispute. If you have a concern relating to the actions of a moderator please contact the mod team privately, or if that is insufficient, please notify @0xF
